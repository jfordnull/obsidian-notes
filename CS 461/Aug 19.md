Philosophical questions about AI:
- AI as extension, duplication of human faculty/mind
- Brain as biological memory machine
"Artificial" Intelligence: artifice, art, constructed intelligence, non-biological 

Biological metaphors
- Genetic material as dataset
- Intelligence as adaptation to environment

Turing's *The Imitation Game* definition: if it looks, acts like intelligence, it is

Guided v. Unguided Search (Pathfinding crucial to intelligence; relationships between nodes, sorting, retrieval. Sorting intuitive to human cognition, subset of higher order problem-solving.) Adversarial Search in games. Stochastic (randomized) search

Heuristic: "Rule of thumb", step beyond algorithmic problem-solving. Like biological "gut instinct"
