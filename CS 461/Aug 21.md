What does thought involve? Is it self-reflexive? Requiring personal identity, self-awareness? Decision-driven behavior different from lower-order animal's instinct-driven behavior, the latter resembling an algorithmic process. By analogy, instinct is firmware, and thought is a software layer abstraction atop instinctual framework. 

Brain is a reward-driven machine. Behavior is linked to thought through our predictive capacity. (Which brings us back to Bayesian inference at the root of intelligent decision-making.)

Is the capacity to know the right thing to do and do the wrong thing evidence of intelligent behavior? Or free will? Or just a conflict of possible rewards? One of the most basic rewards is conservation of energy. From the biological perspective, machinery of intelligence - a significant energy expense - must be for survival. And yet, autonomous cycles of behavior - pursuit of food and procreation - don't necessarily evoke intelligent behavior, even if our intelligent decision-making ultimately serves the basic needs of our survival.

Intelligent Criteria:
Acting *humanly*:
- General knowledge, natural language processing, social cues
- Turing Test: Can an AI communicating via text convince someone it's human?
Acting *rationally*:
- Can a system integrate information about its environment and formulate a plan of action?
- Reasoning in the presence of incomplete information, identifying costs and trade-offs
- Capacity to explain behavior 
Thinking *humanly*:
- Logic, sensing, learning via human mechanisms
- Identifying "laws of thought"
- Human-interpretable rationalizations 
Thinking *rationally*:
- Logic, perception, drawing conclusions
