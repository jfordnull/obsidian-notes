From data to knowledge:
	Raw data -> fact (e.g. data with a unit) -> context -> knowledge (processing of info necessary for decision-making)

Good knowledge representation:
- Transparent - internal processes are well understood; knowledge should be portable
- Parsimonious - The model or method is the minimally viable set (easy to understand)
- Easy to relate to the real world entities it represents knowledge of

Representing types of knowledge:
- Objects - concepts, properties of data structure
- Events - time element, cause/effect, sequencing
- Performance
- Meta-knowledge - reflection, knowledge about knowledge
- Extensional (explicit and specific, e.g. 1, 3, 5) or intensional (short, compact, implicit, e.g. Odd numbers < 6)
- Executability v. comprehensibility
