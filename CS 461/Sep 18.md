**Evaluating Search Methods (cont.):**
- Depending on the problem, state transitions may or may not be reversible
- We can produce a *state-space graph* to describe problem/state-transitions
- Maximum or average number of transitions existing out of a particular state is the *branching factor*
- If we select only transitions that avoid cycles, we produce a *search tree*.
- Greedy decisions (without historical inference) in this system often result in cycles
