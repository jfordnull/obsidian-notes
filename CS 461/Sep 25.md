**Greedy Algorithms (cont.)**
- A greedy algorithm always has some objective function that is to be optimized - usually minimized (cost, distance, time, etc.)
- A greedy algorithm selects the path that looks best based on local information. Agent makes inferences based on belief state

We'll focus on adversarial spaces when we discuss search operations.
