Asimov's I, Robot:
- Inescapable set of linguistic semantic clauses to constrain AI to reasonable expectations

Kant's Critique of Pure Reason:
- No logical axiom we can't use logic to escape, invalidate

Linguistic semantic logic and hard mathematical (symbolic, binary) logic use similar axioms but not wholly compatible; Reality is continuous, fuzzy. 

Godard's Law:
- When the measure becomes the goal, the measure is no longer a reasonable metric
- e.g. I come to nail factory and say our goal is quantity of nails. Factory generates millions of tiny, useless nails. I say we need thicker nails. Factory generates one enormous nail. No adherence to intent of stated goal but to machine objective function
- Creating metrics of qualitative performance is far in advance of creating quantitative performance metrics
- Never expect ethical behavior from a machine

Foundations of AI:
- Neuroscience
	- GPUs still far inferior to the energy efficiency, processing ability of the human brain. We may be approaching the asymptotic limit with regard to chip density
- Psychology
	- As engineers, we should adhere to something like Hippocratic oath
	- Interesting aside: patients feel comfortable being open with an LLM because it lacks the capacity to judge them. Or in commerce: self-serve kiosks lead to more impulsive purchases. Advertising may be the driver of statistics and behavioral psychology. 
- Computer Engineering
- Control Theory and Cybernetics
- Linguistics

To define "rational" we require:
- The performance measure that defines success
- Agent's knowledge of the environment
- Actions the agent can perform
- Agent's percept sequence
Cyclic or recursive mapping of percepts to actions

# Heuristics
AI often relies on applying **heuristics** (a "rule of thumb", which usually gets an approximate answer *quickly*) rather than algorithms (which always gets a correct answer, exactly, *eventually*).
- e.g. A very simple heuristic is the breaking of a stalemate or deadlock through arbitrary decision-making, common in AI for games
- If we need to solve systems of arbitrary complexity, or functionally infinite possible solutions, algorithmic methods (which provide the *best*) answer, exceed the time we have. Goal of AI heuristics is to reduce
