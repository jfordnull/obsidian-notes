# Introduction to Database Systems

Enhanced entity-relationship modeling gives us conceptual database design. Normalization gives us logical database design, or a set of normalized relations.

Database System
- User-facing application programs/queries
- DBMS
- Database(s)

Data and Metadata
- Structured, semi-structured, unstructured

Entity, Attribute, and Relationship
- ER, EER modeling
- Attribute: data property of entity

A database system supports one or more databases by providing languages and services that make it possible for users (DBAs, programmers, general users) to build, maintain, and efficiently query and update the database(s).
- DML (Data manipulation language)
- DDL (Data definition language)
SQL:
- CREATE TABLE (structure data, create relationships)
- INSERT
- DELETE
- QUERY - SELECT FROM WHERE

A database is a large, persistent, integrated collection of dynamic data that provides some operations to describe, establish, manipulate, and access the data.

A database management system is a software system that enables users to define, create, and maintain the database and that provides controlled access to the database.
