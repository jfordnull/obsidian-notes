ANSI-SPARC Three-level architecture:
- External: Users' view of database
- Conceptual: Community view of database
	- Entities, attributes, their relationships
	- Constraints on the data
	- Security, integrity information
- Internal: Physical representation of database

Schema: overall description of database
- External schema (subschemas)
- Conceptual schema
- Internal schema

DBMS responsible for mapping between the schemas. Two-stage mapping in the ANSI-SPARC architecture:
- Conceptual/internal mapping (physical data independence)
- External/conceptual mapping (logical data independence)

Database Languages:
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
	- Procedural DML
	- Non-procedural DML
---
Data Model consists of
- A structural part, consisting of a set of rules according to which databases can be constructed
- A manipulative part, defining operations that are allowed
- Integrity Constraints
