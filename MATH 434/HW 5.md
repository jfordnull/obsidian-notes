We have a function $f(x)=exp(-x^2)$ that we need to integrate over the interval [2,12]. Using composite trapezoid rule, if the partition of the interval is n = 4, write out (no need to compute the value) the expression of the composite trapezoid rule 

In constructing the cubic spline, you can write the standardized piecewise cubic polynomial as $Q_i(t)=at^3+bt^2+ct+d$. You can work out the coefficients by using the following conditions: $Q_i(0)=y_i$, $Q_i(1)=y_{i+1}$, $Q'_i(0)=h_iy'_i$, $Q'_i(1)=h_iy'_{i+1}$. Then, prove that $Q_i(t)$ is equivalent to the form:
$$Q_i(t)=y_i(1-3t^2+2t^3)+y_{i+1}(3t^2-2t^3)+h_iy'_i(t-2t^2+t^3)+h_iy'_{i+1}(-t^2+t^3)$$

For 1-point Gauss quadrature, the weight and node are $w_0$ and $x_0$.
If $\int_a^b=p_k(x)dx=w_0f(x_0)$, where $p_k$ is kth degree polynomial, what is the largest k? And why?  

$\int_1^3(2x-1)dx$
