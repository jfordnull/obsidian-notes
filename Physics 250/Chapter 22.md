**Electric Force** is the force acting between electrically charged objects.
- Positive charge (protons)
- Negative charge (electrons)
Same sign charges repel. Opposites attract.

Electric charge is *always conserved* in an *isolated system*.

Electric charge $q$ is said to be *quantized*; That is, always occurs as integral multiples of fundamental charge $e$.
$$q=\pm Ne$$
Where $N$ is some integer.

- Conductor: electrons can move freely
- Insulator: electrons can't move freely
- Semiconductors: Somewhere in between (e.g. silicon)

**Coulomb's Law**
Magnitude of electric force between two point charges ($q_1,q_2$) given by:
$$F_e=k_e\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$
Where $r$ is the distance between them and $k_e$ is the *Coulomb Constant*:
$$k_e=8.9876\times10^9N\cdot m^2/C^2$$
SI unit is the Coulomb (C). Also written in form:
$$k_\epsilon=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$$
Where the constant $\epsilon_0$ is known as the *permittivity of free space* and has value:
$$\epsilon_0=8.8542\times10^{-12}C^2/N\cdot m^2$$
The smallest unit of free charge $e$ known in nature, i.e. electron ($-e$), proton ($+e$), has magnitude:
$$e=1.60218\times10^{-19}C$$
**Coulomb's Law in Vector Form:**
$$\vec{F}_{12}=k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}_{12}$$
Where $\hat{r}_{12}$ is a unit vector directed from $q_1$ to $q_2$. Following Newton's 3rd, $\vec{F}_{12}=-\vec{F}_{21}$. Product $q_1q_2$ positive $\rightarrow$ repellent force, negative $\rightarrow$ attractive.

**Electric field** is said to exist around a charged object, the *source charge*. Can be detected by placing a *test charge* in the field and observing electric force on it.

**Electric Field Vector** $\vec{E}$ at a point in space is defined as the electric force $\vec{F}_e$ acting on a positive test charge $q_0$ placed at that point divided by the test charge:
$$\vec{E}\equiv\frac{\vec{F}_e}{q_0}$$
SI units of Newtons per Coulomb (N/C). Direction of $\vec{E}$ is the direction of force a positive test charge experiences.

If an arbitrary charge $q$ is placed in this electric field, it experiences electric force given by:
$$\vec{F}_e=q\vec{E}$$
**Vector Form of Electric Field**
$$\vec{E}=k_e\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}$$
Electric Field at point P due to a group of source charges, vector sum:
$$\vec{E}=k_e\sum\frac{q_i}{r^2_i}\hat{r}_i$$
Where $r_i$ is the distance of the $i$th source charge $q_i$ to the point P and $\hat{r}_i$ is a unit vector directed from $q_i$ toward P.
# 22.5

**Electric Field Lines**: The number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge or approaching a negative charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.
# 22.6

**Motion of a Charged Particle:**
$$\sum\vec{F}=q\vec{E}=m\vec{a}$$
And the acceleration of particle is:
$$\vec{a}=\frac{q\vec{E}}{m}$$
