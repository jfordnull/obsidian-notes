Previous electric field equation useful for calculating E due to small number of charges. Often we have *continuous* distribution of electric charge rather than discrete charges.
# Electric Field, Continuous Charge DIstribution

The electric field at P due to a continuous charge distribution is the vector sum of the fields $\Delta \vec{E}$ due to all the elements $\Delta q_i$ of the charge distribution:

$$\vec{E}=k_e\lim_{\Delta q_i \rightarrow 0}\sum_i\frac{\Delta q_i}{r_i^2}\hat{r}_i=k_e\int\frac{dq}{r^2}\hat{r}$$
Where integration is over entire charge distribution.

E.g. charge distributed over a line, area, and volume. Use concept of *charge density* with the following notations:

**Volume Charge Density**:
$$\rho\equiv\frac{Q}{V}$$
(SI unit $C/m^3$)

**Area Charge Density**:
$$\sigma\equiv\frac{Q}{A}$$
($C/m^2$)

**Linear Charge Density**:
$$\lambda\equiv\frac{Q}{l}$$
($C/m$)

If nonuniform distribution of charge, $dq$ is given as: $dq = \rho dV$,
