# Magnetic Fields

Region of space surrounding any *moving* electric charge contains a **magnetic field**.

The existence of magnetic field at some point in space can be determined by measuring the **magnetic force** $\vec{F}_B$ exerted on a test particle at that point.

- The magnetic force is proportional to the charge $q$ of the particle.
- The magnetic force on a negative charge is directed opposite to the force on a positive charge moving in the same direction.
- The magnetic force is proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field vector $\vec{B}$.
- The magnetic force is proportional to the speed $v$ of the particle.
- If the velocity vector makes an angle $\theta$ with the magnetic field, the magnitude of the magnetic force is proportional to sin $\theta$.
- When a charged particle moves _parallel_ to the magnetic field vector, the magnetic force on the charge is zero.
- When a charged particle moves in a direction _not_ parallel to the magnetic field vector, the magnetic force acts in a direction perpendicular to both $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{B}$; that is, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the plane formed by $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{B}$.

**Magnetic Force** (on a charged particle)
$$\vec{F}_B=q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$$
**Magnitude of Magnetic Force on Charged Particle**:
$$F_B=|q|vBsin\theta$$
where $\theta$ is the smaller angle between $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{B}$. From this expression, we see that $F_B$ is zero when $\vec{v}$ is parallel or antiparallel to $\vec{B}$ ($\theta = 0 | 180$), and maximum when $\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{B}$.

The SI unit of $\vec{B}$ is a Tesla (T), where 
$$1T=1\frac{N}{A\cdot m}$$

If a charged particle moves in a uniform magnetic field so that its initial velocity is perpendicular to the field, the particle moves in a circle, the plane of which is perpendicular to the magnetic field. The radius of the circular path is:
$$r=\frac{mv}{qB}$$
where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $q$ is its charge. The angular speed of the charged particle is:
$$\omega=\frac{qB}{m}$$

If a straight conductor of length $L$ carries a current $I$, the force exerted on that conductor when it is placed in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is:
$$\vec{F}_B=I\vec{L}\times\vec{B}$$
where the direction of $\vec{L}$ is the direction of the current and $|\vec{L}|=L$

The torque $\vec{\tau}$ on a current loop placed in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is 
$$\vec{\tau}=\vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}$$
---

If an arbitrarily shaped wire carrying a current $I$ is placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic force exerted on a very small segment $d\vec{s}$ is
$$d\vec{F}_B=Id\vec{s}\times\vec{B}$$
To determine the total magnetic force on the wire, we must integrate this equation over the wire, keeping in mind that both $\vec{B}$ and $d\vec{s}$ may vary at each point.

The potential energy of the system of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is 
$$U_B=-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}$$
